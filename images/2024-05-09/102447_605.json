    "description": "This image shows an interior space with a ceiling-mounted light fixture in the center. The room has a white or off-white color scheme, and there is an interesting lighting effect cast onto the ceiling, suggesting the presence of another light source out of view. There are linear light fixtures on the ceiling that appear to be turned off. On the wall to the left, there is a recessed lighting feature running along its length, providing a row of lights that seem to be turned off. The floor of the room is not visible in this image. The space appears modern and minimalistic, with a focus on clean lines and simple design elements."
